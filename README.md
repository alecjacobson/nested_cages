## Compilation

This code has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. In theory this should also
work on Windows.

To compile, 

 1. _**Install CGAL**_. This project requires at least version 4.7 of CGAL
    (newer versions might work also); note that the CGAL Debian package may not
    be sufficiently new. Then 
 2. Issue:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  ..
make
```

This will build all remaining dependencies and the `nested_cages` executable.

### Dependencies

The main dependencies libigl, eltopo and collisiondetection are included as  [git
submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule). If you clone this repo
using `git clone --recursive` then the dependency layout should be:

    nested_cages/
      collisiondetection/
      eltopo/
      eigen/
      libigl/

The cmake build of libigl will further download cgal and tetgen as external
dependencies.


## Example usages

Help information

    ./nested_cages

Obtain 2 volume minimizing nested cages for `../gargo.off`: one regular with
1000 faces and the other regular with 500 faces. Output resulting cages to
`../test_1.off` and `../test_2.off`

    ./nested_cages ../gargo.off 2 1000r 500r None Volume ../test

The same as above, but outputs adaptive decimations (instead of regular)

    ./nested_cages ../gargo.off 2 1000 500 None Volume ../test

Obtain 2 nested cages for `../gargo.off` that minimize surface ARAP energy,
using as input decimations `../gargo_1000.off` and `gargo_500.off`

    ./nested_cages ../gargo.off 2 ../gargo_1000.off ../gargo_500.off SurfARAP None ../test
